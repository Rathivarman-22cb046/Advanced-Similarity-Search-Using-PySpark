Advanced Similarity Search Using PySpark
Overview
This project focuses on implementing advanced similarity search techniques using Apache Spark and PySpark. It provides scalable and efficient methods to calculate similarity between high-dimensional data points, sets, or numerical values.

Features
Similarity Metrics:
Cosine Similarity
Euclidean Distance
Jaccard Similarity
Approximate Similarity Search:
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
Distributed Processing:
Handles large datasets with Spark's distributed computing.
Preprocessing:
Integration with Spark MLlib for data normalization and vectorization.
Requirements
System Requirements:

Python 3.7 or higher
Java 8 or higher
Apache Spark 3.x or higher
Optional: Hadoop for HDFS storage
Python Dependencies:

PySpark
NumPy
Optional: Scikit-learn for data generation
Getting Started
Environment Setup:

Install Apache Spark and Java.
Set up environment variables for SPARK_HOME and add Spark to the system PATH.
Dataset:

Supported formats: CSV, Parquet, JSON.
Place the dataset in a local or HDFS directory.
Run the Project:

Use PySpark scripts to execute similarity searches with desired configurations.
Use Cases
Recommendation Systems
Document Similarity in Natural Language Processing
age and Feature Matching
Anomaly Detection
Data Input and Output
Input:
A dataset containing feature vectors or sets for similarity analysis.
Output:
A similarity matrix or pairs of similar items with scores.
Results
The results provide insights into the closeness of items in the dataset based on the chosen similarity metric.
